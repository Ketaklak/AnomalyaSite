<h2>1. PURPOSE</h2>
<p>The purpose of these Terms of Use (the “Terms”) is to define the rights and obligations of the users (“User”, “you”, or “your”) when using our software application (the “Bot” or “Synthia”), our Platform (accessible at the website hosting the service) and the related features (the “Features”).</p>

<h2>2. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS – CHANGES TO TERMS</h2>
<p>
  By accessing or using any of the Features, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. You also agree that any personal data and electronic communications on our Platform or through the use of the Features will be processed in accordance with our Privacy Policy (available on our Privacy Policy page).
</p>
<p>
  AnomalyaCorp reserves the right to modify or replace these Terms at any time. The most current version will be posted on the Platform. It is your responsibility to review the Terms periodically. Your continued use of the Features after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.
</p>

<h2>3. PROVISIONS OF AND ACCESS TO FEATURES</h2>

<p>
  Unless otherwise specified in these Terms or on the Platform, the Platform is operated, the license is granted, and the Features are offered by <strong>AnomalyaCorp</strong> (“Owner”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). Synthia is not acting as an agent or service provider of Discord.
</p>

<h3>3.2 User’s Eligibility</h3>

</p>

<h3>3.3 Features</h3>
<p>
  As a User, you have access to the Features as described on the Platform. The Features may evolve over time at our discretion. The applicable fees (if any) cover a general use of the Features.

<h3>3.4 Account Registration</h3>

</p>

<h3>3.5 Duration and Access to the Features</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Subscriptions:</strong> Paid subscriptions grant you continuous or periodic access to the Features from the date your payment is received. To maintain access, you must pay the recurring fee on time. Failure to do so may result in service interruption or termination.

<p>
  <strong>Automatic Renewal:</strong> Subscriptions are automatically renewed via your selected payment method unless canceled within the termination deadline specified.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Termination:</strong> We may terminate or suspend your access to the Features (without liability) if you breach these Terms, fail to pay fees, or for any other reason deemed necessary to protect our reputation and interests.
